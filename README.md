# ‚ù§Ô∏è This repository contains the implementation of a data-driven, risk-aware algorithm designed to enable safe and efficient navigation of an autonomous drone in dynamic environments. 
The core of the system is a Model Predictive Control (MPC) planner enhanced with risk-aware decision-making capabilities to handle moving obstacles and environmental uncertainties in real-time.

ü§ì Key components include:

  Risk-Aware MPC Planner using the Gurobi optimizer.

  Monte Carlo (MC) Simulations for performance evaluation under uncertainty.

  MATLAB prototyping for algorithm development and validation.

ü§ì Features

Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance: Achieves a 30% improvement in collision avoidance efficiency compared to baseline planners.

Risk-Aware Decision Making: Incorporates probabilistic risk models for safe navigation in dynamic, stochastic environments.

Hardware-Ready Performance: Optimized for real-time execution on an Intel i7-9700k CPU @ 3.6GHz.
